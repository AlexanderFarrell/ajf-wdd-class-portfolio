<p>Notes:</p>
Exceptions are normally either
<ul>
	<li>The System</li>
	<li>Me (Programmer)</li>
	<li>The user</li>
</ul>
Programmers try to limit all of these. Work with the system. Check oneself. And help the user.

Exception is an error which has a return value the program can use to interpret the error..

JavaScript is pretty much the opposite of Rust in errors, whereby its super forgiving and will just keep running on most errors.

Strict mode is available for JavaScript.

debugger keyword adds breakpoints for you.

Errors have the following:
<ul>
	<li>Name - The error type</li>
	<li>Message - What happened.</li>
	<li>Stack - What led up to it</li>
</ul>

Just making a function can be a test



Test Driven Development:
<ol>
	<li>Make Tests</li>
	<li>Write code, pass tests</li>
	<li>Refactor</li>
	<li>Test that refactored code</li>
</ol>

New features come from tests. Require things and then deliver.
