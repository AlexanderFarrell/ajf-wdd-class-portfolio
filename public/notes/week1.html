<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are events global things? I've always used them on an element, like onclick, yet they're called page events?</li>
	<li>Can style tags operate exactly like a css file? Are they different in any way?</li>
	<li>What is the exact difference between innerHTML and innerText? I may be mistaken, but I remember using innerText once and it styled it, removing the HTML tags and applying such styles.</li>
</ul>
